## ‚úÖ What You Already Know

When you annotate a method or class with:

```java
@Transactional
public void myMethod() {
    // some DB logic
}
```

‚Ä¶it works **without you writing any boilerplate** like opening/committing/rolling back transactions.

---

## ü§ñ So How Does It Actually Work?

### üîß 1. **Spring AOP Proxy Mechanism**

Spring **wraps your bean in a proxy** at runtime if it sees `@Transactional`.

There are 2 types of proxies:

* **JDK Dynamic Proxy** ‚Äì if your class implements an interface
* **CGLIB Proxy** ‚Äì if your class does not implement an interface

üîÅ These proxies wrap your bean method calls and allow Spring to **inject extra logic**, like transaction handling, before/after your actual method runs.

---

### üîç 2. **What Happens at Runtime?**

When you call a transactional method like:

```java
userService.createUser();
```

This is what happens behind the scenes:

1. **Proxy intercepts the call**
2. Checks for `@Transactional`
3. Delegates to **TransactionInterceptor**
4. TransactionInterceptor interacts with **PlatformTransactionManager**
5. The transaction manager (e.g., `DataSourceTransactionManager` for JDBC) does:

   * Starts transaction (get connection, set autocommit false)
   * Executes your method
   * Commits if success, rolls back if exception

### üîÑ Internally: Important Classes

| Component                    | Role                                                                           |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `@Transactional`             | Metadata that marks a method for transaction                                   |
| `TransactionInterceptor`     | Core logic to handle begin, commit, rollback                                   |
| `PlatformTransactionManager` | SPI for managing transactions (like JDBC, JPA)                                 |
| `TransactionAttributeSource` | Parses the attributes from `@Transactional`                                    |
| `TransactionManager`         | Concrete class (e.g., `DataSourceTransactionManager`, `JpaTransactionManager`) |

---

### üì¶ Typical Flow Internally (Simplified)

```
Caller --> Proxy --> TransactionInterceptor
         --> TransactionManager (begin)
         --> Actual Method Call
         --> TransactionManager (commit or rollback)
```

---

### üí° Even Without @Transactional?

If you call `repository.save()` without `@Transactional`, JPA (Hibernate) **defers DB writing until flush time** ‚Äî but:

* If you're **inside a Spring-managed method with no `@Transactional`**, the **default is non-transactional**.
* Some operations may still work because Hibernate can work with its **session-level transaction** (but it‚Äôs risky).
* **Best practice**: use `@Transactional` at the service layer.

---

### üß™ Example

```java
@Service
public class UserService {

    @Transactional
    public void registerUser(User user) {
        userRepository.save(user); // triggers DB insert
        // any exception here will rollback the transaction
    }
}
```

Here, Spring:

* Starts transaction at method entry
* Commits at method exit (if no exception)
* Rolls back if runtime exception is thrown

---

### üìå Common Pitfall (Important)

* If you call a `@Transactional` method **from within the same class**, the proxy is bypassed. So transaction will **not work** as expected.

```java
public void outerMethod() {
   innerTransactionalMethod(); // doesn't go through proxy, so @Transactional is ignored
}
```

---

## üß† Summary

| Concept                    | How It Works                                           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Proxy                      | Spring creates a proxy to intercept method calls       |
| @Transactional             | Parsed by AOP and injected into proxy logic            |
| TransactionInterceptor     | Applies begin, commit, rollback logic                  |
| PlatformTransactionManager | Concrete logic for JDBC, JPA, etc.                     |
| No manual code             | You just use `@Transactional` and Spring does the rest |

## üîÑ Calling `@Transactional` from Within the Same Class ‚Äî Why It Fails

### ‚ùó The Problem: **Proxy Bypass**

Spring handles transactions using **AOP proxies**. That means:

* Your bean is wrapped in a **proxy object**
* When an **external class** calls a method like `userService.saveUser()`, it goes **through the proxy**, which handles the transaction logic.

BUT...

If a method **within the same class** calls another `@Transactional` method, it‚Äôs a **direct call**, like `this.someTransactionalMethod()`, which **bypasses the proxy**. So the transaction logic is **never triggered**.

---

### ‚úÖ Working (external call)

```java
@Service
public class UserService {
    
    @Transactional
    public void saveUser(User user) {
        userRepository.save(user);
    }
}
```

```java
// External call goes through proxy ‚Äî transaction starts
userService.saveUser(user);
```

‚úî Transaction works because Spring's proxy intercepts the method call.

---

### ‚ùå Not Working (internal call)

```java
@Service
public class UserService {

    public void registerUser(User user) {
        // calling transactional method inside same class
        saveUser(user); // ‚ùå proxy is bypassed
    }

    @Transactional
    public void saveUser(User user) {
        userRepository.save(user);
    }
}
```

‚õî Here, `registerUser()` calls `saveUser()` directly inside the same class. So the call doesn't go through the proxy, and `@Transactional` is **ignored**.

---

## üîç So When Does `@Transactional` Work?

| Call Type                  | Goes Through Proxy | Transaction Applies |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| Called from another bean   | ‚úÖ Yes              | ‚úÖ Yes               |
| Called from same class     | ‚ùå No               | ‚ùå No                |
| Called via `this.method()` | ‚ùå No               | ‚ùå No                |

---

## üîÑ How to Fix This?

### ‚úÖ Best Practice:

Put transactional methods in a **separate service class**, so they're always called through a proxy.

---

## üîé Now, About This Example

```java
public void save(User user) {
  userRepository.save(user);
}
```

You asked why this works **without** `@Transactional`.

### ‚òë Yes, it ‚Äúworks‚Äù‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs **not transactional** in the Spring sense.

* When you call `repository.save()` (e.g., JPA), Hibernate will **queue the insert** in its persistence context.
* If no transaction exists, the **actual SQL** might:

  * Run in **auto-commit mode** (one statement = one transaction)
  * Or may be **deferred** until flush

But:

| With `@Transactional`          | Without `@Transactional`                      |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| All operations in one unit     | Each statement might run in auto-commit       |
| Rollback possible on exception | No rollback; partial updates may happen       |
| Safe for multiple operations   | Risky if multiple steps depend on one another |

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Why Is This Risky?

Without `@Transactional`, if you're:

* Saving multiple entities
* Modifying multiple tables
* Doing multiple operations that depend on each other

‚Ä¶then failure in one step will not rollback the others!
