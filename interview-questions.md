## Modern Java Interview Questions

# Java Full Stack Senior Engineer — Interview Questions and Answers

## Section 1: Core Java (Collections, Threading, OOPS)

### Collections

1. **Difference between List, Set, and Map?**
- **List**: Ordered, allows duplicates (Ex: `ArrayList`)
- **Set**: Unordered, no duplicates (Ex: `HashSet`)
- **Map**: Key-value pairs, unique keys (Ex: `HashMap`)

2. **Difference between HashMap and ConcurrentHashMap?**
- **HashMap**: Not thread-safe
- **ConcurrentHashMap**: Thread-safe, locks at bucket level

3. **What is HashSet backed by?**
- HashSet uses a **HashMap** internally

4. **Difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?**
- **ArrayList**: Fast random access (O(1)), slower insert/delete
- **LinkedList**: Slow random access (O(n)), faster insert/delete at start/middle

5. **Fail-fast vs Fail-safe?**
- **Fail-fast**: Throws `ConcurrentModificationException` (e.g., `ArrayList`)
- **Fail-safe**: Works on a copy (e.g., `ConcurrentHashMap`)

6. **Difference between HashMap and Hashtable?**
- **HashMap**: Not synchronized
- **Hashtable**: Synchronized (legacy)

7. **Difference between TreeMap and HashMap?**
- **TreeMap**: Sorted by keys (O(log n))
- **HashMap**: Unordered (O(1))

8. **What is Comparable vs Comparator?**
- **Comparable**: Natural ordering (`compareTo()` inside class)
- **Comparator**: Custom ordering (external)

9. **What is BlockingQueue?**
- Thread-safe queue that blocks when empty/full (Ex: `ArrayBlockingQueue`)

### Threading

1. **Difference between Runnable and Callable?**
- **Runnable**: No result, no exception
- **Callable**: Returns result, can throw exception

2. **Synchronized vs Lock?**
- **Synchronized**: Simpler, intrinsic lock
- **Lock (ReentrantLock)**: Explicit locking, tryLock, fair lock

3. **What is volatile keyword?**
- Ensures visibility of changes to variables across threads

4. **Difference between wait(), sleep(), and yield()?**
- **wait()**: Releases lock, inter-thread communication
- **sleep()**: Pauses thread, holds lock
- **yield()**: Hints scheduler to switch thread (no guarantee)

5. **Thread-safe Singleton implementation?**
```java
public class Singleton {
    private static volatile Singleton instance;

6. **Difference between ExecutorService and ForkJoinPool?**

- Provides thread-confined variables (one copy per thread)

### OOPS

1. **4 Pillars of OOPS?**
- Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism

2. **Abstract class vs Interface?**
- **Abstract**: Can have fields, constructor, behavior

3. **Overloading vs Overriding?**
- **Overloading**: Same method name, different params (compile time)
- **Overriding**: Same signature, subclass modifies (runtime)

4. **What is encapsulation?**

- Same method name behaves differently (compile/runtime)

6. **What is composition vs inheritance?**
- **Composition**: HAS-A relationship (more flexible)
- **Inheritance**: IS-A relationship (tight coupling)

Perfect — let's move to **Section 4: Microservices**  
Here’s a **focused list of most-asked Microservices interview questions with short crisp answers** for senior roles.  

---

# 📂 **Microservices**

### 1️⃣ What is Microservices Architecture?  
- Design style where an application is a **collection of small, loosely coupled services**, each responsible for a single business capability.

---

### 2️⃣ Monolithic vs Microservices  
| Monolithic | Microservices |
|------------|---------------|
| Single deployable unit | Independent deployable services |
| Tight coupling | Loose coupling |
| Difficult to scale specific parts | Independent scaling |
| Technology lock-in | Polyglot (multiple tech possible) |

---

### 3️⃣ How do Microservices communicate?  
- **Synchronous**: REST, gRPC  
- **Asynchronous**: Kafka, RabbitMQ, JMS

---

### 4️⃣ What is service discovery?  
- Process where services **register themselves** and **discover other services dynamically**  
Example: **Eureka**, **Consul**, **Zookeeper**

---

### 5️⃣ API Gateway - Why is it needed?  
- Entry point for all clients → handles routing, load balancing, security, rate limiting  
Examples: **Spring Cloud Gateway**, **Zuul**, **Kong**, **NGINX**

---

### 6️⃣ How to handle failures in Microservices?  
- **Circuit Breaker** (Resilience4j, Hystrix)  
- **Retry**, **Fallback**, **Timeouts**, **Bulkhead pattern**  
- **Service mesh** (Istio, Linkerd)

---

### 7️⃣ What is Circuit Breaker Pattern?  
- Prevents a service from making calls to a failing service.  
If failures cross a threshold → circuit “opens” → skips calls → avoids cascading failure.

---

### 8️⃣ How to handle distributed transactions?  
- **Saga Pattern** (Orchestration / Choreography)  
- **Two-Phase Commit (2PC)** — less recommended due to complexity and locking.

---

### 9️⃣ What is Saga Pattern?  
- **Orchestration**: Central coordinator controls transactions  
- **Choreography**: Services communicate via events (no central coordinator)

---

### 1️⃣0️⃣ What is Idempotency?  
- Same request can be executed multiple times → result remains same  
Example: `DELETE /user/1` should always return success even if user is already deleted

---

### 1️⃣1️⃣ What is eventual consistency?  
- In distributed systems → all services **will become consistent over time**, but not immediately (vs strong consistency)

---

### 1️⃣2️⃣ How do you secure Microservices?  
- OAuth2, OpenID Connect  
- JWT Tokens (Stateless auth)  
- API Gateway as security layer  
- Mutual TLS (mTLS) between services

---

### 1️⃣3️⃣ What is service mesh?  
- Dedicated infrastructure layer to handle **service-to-service communication**  
Features: **Load balancing, retries, security, telemetry**  
Examples: **Istio**, **Linkerd**

---

### 1️⃣4️⃣ Key Microservice Design Patterns?  
✅ Circuit Breaker  
✅ API Gateway

- **Logging**: ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)  
- **Tracing**: Zipkin, Jaeger  
- **Metrics**: Prometheus, Grafana  
- **Health Checks**: /actuator/health (Spring Boot)

---

### 1️⃣9️⃣ How does load balancing work?  
- **Client-side** (Ribbon)  
- **Server-side** (API Gateway, NGINX)

---

### 2️⃣0️⃣ How to version Microservices APIs?  
- URI versioning (`/api/v1/users`)  
- Request Header versioning

---

### 2️⃣1️⃣ How to manage dependencies between microservices?  
- Keep services **loosely coupled**  
- Use **asynchronous communication** where possible (events/Kafka)
---

## 🟠 **Oracle / SQL**

### 1️⃣ Difference between `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`  
- `INNER JOIN`: only matching rows  
- `LEFT JOIN`: all rows from left + matching from right  
- `RIGHT JOIN`: all rows from right + matching from left

---

### 2️⃣ What is normalization?  
- Organizing data to reduce **redundancy** and improve **data integrity**  
- Normal forms: **1NF**, **2NF**, **3NF**, **BCNF**

---

### 3️⃣ ACID properties  
✅ **Atomicity** — All or nothing  
✅ **Consistency** — Valid state  
✅ **Isolation** — Concurrent txn isolation  
✅ **Durability** — Persist after commit

---

### 4️⃣ Difference between `WHERE` and `HAVING`?  
- `WHERE`: filters rows **before grouping**  
- `HAVING`: filters **after grouping**

---

### 5️⃣ Index vs Unique Key vs Primary Key  
| Feature | Index | Unique Key | Primary Key |
|---------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Uniqueness | No | Yes | Yes |
| NULL allowed | Yes | Yes (1 NULL) | No |
| Count allowed | Many | Many | 1 |

---

### 6️⃣ How to optimize SQL query?  
- Proper indexes  
- Avoid `SELECT *`  
- Use **EXISTS** over **IN** (in large subqueries)  
- Optimize joins  
- Analyze execution plan

---

### 7️⃣ What is execution plan?  
- Shows how SQL engine **executes a query** (index scan, full scan etc.)

---

### 8️⃣ Difference between clustered and non-clustered index?  
- **Clustered**: rearranges actual data (1 per table)  
- **Non-clustered**: separate index structure (many per table)

---

## 🟢 **NoSQL / MongoDB**

| SQL | NoSQL |
|-----|-------|
| Relational | Non-relational |
| Fixed schema | Flexible schema |

✅ **Partition Tolerance** — continues despite network splits  
👉 Can have **at most 2 out of 3** in distributed DB

---

### 1️⃣1️⃣ What is Document-Oriented DB?  
- Stores data as **JSON-like documents**  
Example: **MongoDB**

---

### 1️⃣2️⃣ Key features of MongoDB

✅ JSON-like documents (BSON)  
✅ High availability (replica sets)  
✅ Horizontal scaling (sharding)

---

### 1️⃣3️⃣ What is sharding?  
- **Horizontal partitioning** → split large collections across multiple servers

---

### 1️⃣4️⃣ What is replication in MongoDB?  
- Copies data across multiple servers (replica set) → High availability & failover

---

### 1️⃣5️⃣ MongoDB vs RDBMS  
| MongoDB | RDBMS |
|---------|-------|
| JSON docs | Tables + rows |
| No joins (embedding/refs) | Joins |
| Horizontal scaling | Vertical scaling |
